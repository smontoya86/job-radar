scoring:
  # Description-Centric Scoring Algorithm (v2)
  # The algorithm prioritizes job DESCRIPTION analysis over title matching.
  # A "Staff PM" with AI/ML heavy description scores higher than "AI PM" with generic description.
  #
  # New weights (hardcoded in keyword_matcher.py):
  #   - Description keyword relevance: 40% (primary signal)
  #   - Title relevance: 20% (partial credit for related titles)
  #   - Keyword variety & density: 15% (more different keywords = better)
  #   - Company tier: 15%
  #   - Salary/Remote: 10%
  #
  # Legacy weights (kept for reference, not used):
  title_match: 0.20  # Reduced from 0.35
  keyword_match: 0.40  # Increased, now focuses on description
  company_tier: 0.15
  salary_match: 0.05
